Imagine this. You are in a bootcamp learning to code. You and your fellow classmates are given a task just 8 weeks into your journey in Web Development. This task turns out to be a fullstack web application using Heroku to store data and SQL to interact with that database. After panicking, you calm down and realise that you need to practice SQL fast and team up with three other humans who are in the same position as you. 

...And this how this repository came into existance. Using SQL, we refactored existing code for an API (still under development) that used vanilla JavaScript to handle API responses locally to do so on the Cloud. While we did not practice all the SQL queries required to perform CRUD opperations to the API, we managed to create and populate a database table as well as create routes that handled server requests also using SQL. This helped us consolidate our previous knowledge, as well as survive undertaking the task allocated to us. 

We still have a lot to learn. For instance, we did not practicing querying data across multiple tables or even guard our data from possible SQL injections from malicious users. However, we are sure that we will learn this over time.
